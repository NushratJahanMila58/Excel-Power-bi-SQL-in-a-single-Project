# E-commerce Sales Analysis Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an **E-commerce Sales Dataset** using three different approaches:
1. **Excel Dashboard** ‚Äì Data transformation, modeling, and visualization using Power Query, Power Pivot, and DAX.
2. **Power BI Report** ‚Äì Interactive dashboards with advanced visualizations and navigation.
3. **SQL Project** ‚Äì Database design, data normalization, ingestion, and business query analysis.

The dataset includes two files:
- `sales.csv` (main transaction dataset)
- `return_table.csv` (records of returned orders)

The project demonstrates **data cleaning, modeling, KPI measurement, and insightful reporting** for decision-making.

## üîπ Part 3: SQL Project
Tasks completed using **MySQL**:
- **Data Ingestion & Normalization**
  - Loaded `sales.csv` and `return_table.csv` into SQL database.
  - Created **dimension tables** (`dim_location`, `dim_product`, `dim_category`, `dim_sub_category`).
  - Built **fact_transaction** table with foreign keys.
- **Business Insights via Queries**
  - Total Revenue, Net Revenue, and Profit calculations.
  - Order distribution by customer segment & shipping mode.
  - Top 5 products by sales quantity.
  - Monthly revenue trends & YoY growth.
  - Return rate analysis by category & continent.
  - Profitability insights (high-margin categories, negative profit products).
  - Customer & product behavior analysis (frequently bought together, multi-product orders).
  - Abnormal order/shipping cost detection.
